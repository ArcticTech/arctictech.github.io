## Basic Table Structure

This guide goes over how to structure a DynamoDB table for scalability.

Basic Table structure is as follows:

```
{
 "insert_timestamp": "2021-11-21 03:21:31.431931",
 "uuid_ddb": "de1c22f3-d593-4d51-9420-3e80e4a21ea7",
 "example_secondary_index": "example_1",
 "example_data": "data_value",
 "update_timestamp": "2021-11-21 03:21:31.431931"
}
```

How to create in insert_timestamp and uuid_ddb in python:
```
from datetime import datetime
from uuid import uuid4

insert_timestamp = datetime.now())
update_timestamp = uuid4()
```

Configurations of this table:
insert_timestamp - This is the timestamp of when an item was inserted into the table. This makes a good partition key as items will be stacked by date making getting the latest data quite easily. 

uuid_ddb - This is a uuid4 code for a unique sort key.
