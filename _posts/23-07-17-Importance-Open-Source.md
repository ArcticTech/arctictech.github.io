## Importance of Open Source
At Arctic Technology we strongly believe in the power of open source and the importance of contributing to the open source community.

Open source is the most impactful social phenomenon that has allowed the rapid development of innovative and accessible solutions that benefit everyone. It promotes collaboration and transparency, enabling a diverse group of individuals to contribute their expertise, leading to the democratizing of technology and the advancement of knowledge for the common good.

We strive to do our part in contributing to the open source community. This repository of projects, guides, articles, and resources is intended to be used by everyone. Our goal is to make as much of our tools, software, knowledge, and expertise accessible to all, whether it's engineers, coders, educators, and/or students alike.

Yours,

Arctic Technology Team
