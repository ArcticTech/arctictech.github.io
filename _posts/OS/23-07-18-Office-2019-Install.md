## Microsoft Office 2019 Install For Mac

To activate MS Office 2019 for macOS use the VL Serializer tool after installing Office 2019, then run Serializer to activate. See this link for details: https://gist.github.com/zthxxx/9ddc171d00df98cbf8b4b0d8469ce90a

1. Install Office 2019, but DO NOT run the Office app after the installation. Brew install is the preference.
```
brew install --cask microsoft-office
```
